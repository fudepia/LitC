# LitC

## How To Use

### If your project doesn't have `Makefile`

1. You could obtain LitC by either cloning the [`release` branch](https://github.com/fudepia/LitC/tree/release), download [ZIP file](https://github.com/fudepia/LitC/archive/refs/heads/release.zip) of the `release` branch, or download tarball from [Releases page](https://github.com/fudepia/LitC/releases).
2. Extract LitC source code and remove `README.md`
3. Move all the other files to your project's root directory (**NOTICE**: Make sure you've copied `LitC-LICENSE.txt` too).
4. Run command that fits your need (see [`LitC-HowTo.md`](./LitC-HowTo.md)

### If your project already have `Makefile`
